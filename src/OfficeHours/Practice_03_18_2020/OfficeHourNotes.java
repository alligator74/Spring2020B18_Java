Practice Topics:
			All the operators
			single if statement

Package name: Practice_03_18_2020

all operators we have learned:
								+, -, *, /, %

								+=, -=, *=, /=, %=

								+, -, --, ++

								>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=,   !, &&, ||


%: numerator - (denominator * Whole Number for result)

	10 / 3 = 3.333333;
	remiander: 10 - (3 * 3)
				10 - 9
				1


post increment/decrement: first passing the current value, and then increase/decrease by 1
					place the operators after the vairble name

					int a = 20;
						a++;


pre incraement/decrement:  increase/decrease value by 1 immediately
					place the operator before the variable name

					int a = 20;
					++a;





	warmup task:
		write a program that can check the age of a person if he/she is qualified to buy alchohol

		write a code of happiness


|| : as long as one condition is true ==> true

&& : as long as one condition is false ==> false



single if statement:

		if(Condition){
			statements;

		}
